# module 9 Exercise 4: Gates Foundation Educational Grants

# Read the data from the `data/gates_money.csv` file into a variable called
# `grants` using the `read.csv()` function
# Be sure to set your working directory, and do NOT treat strings as factors!

setwd("C:/Users/Lior/Desktop/exercises/module9-dataframes/exercise-4")

grants <- read.csv('data/gates_money.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)


# Use the View function to look at the loaded data

View(grants)

# Create a variable `organization` as the `organizationtotal.amount` column of the dataset
organization <- grants$organization

# Confirm that the "organization" column is a vector using the `is.vector()`
# This is a useful debugging tip if you hit errors later!

is.vector(organization)

### Now you can ask some more interesting questions about the dataset.  Store your answers in variables ###

# What was the mean grant value?

grant.mean <- mean(grants$total_amount)

# What was the dollar amount of the largest grant?

largest.grant <-  max(grants$total_amount)

# What was the dollar amount of the smallest grant?

smallest.grant <-  min(grants$total_amount)


# Which organization received the largest grant?

organization.largestgrant <- organization[grants$total_amount == largest.grant]


# Which organization received the smallest grant?
organization.smallestgrant <- organization[grants$total_amount == smallest.grant]


# How many grants were awarded in 2010?s

length(grants$total_amount[grants$start_year == 2010])
