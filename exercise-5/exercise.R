# module 9 Exercise 5: Popular Baby Names Over Time

# Read in the female baby names .csv file into a variable called `female.names`
# Remember to not load the strings as factors!

# Create a vector `years` as the year column of the dataset

years <- female.names$year

# Create a vector `names` as the name column of the datset

names <- female.names$name


# Create a vector `props` as the proportion column of the dataset

props <- female.names$prop


# Create a vector `names.2013` as your names vector where your years vector is 2013

names.2013 <- names[years == 2013]
# Create a vector `prop.2013` as the your props vector where your years vecctor is 2013

prop.2013 <- props[years == 2013]


# What was the most popular female name in 2013?

most.popular <- names.2013[prop.2013 == max(prop.2013)]

# Write a funciton `most.popular` that takes in a value `my.year`, and returns
# a sentence stating the most popular name in that year. Note how you had to make intermediary variables above.

most.popular <- function(my.year){
  years <- female.names$year
  names.year <- female.names$name[years==my.year]
  prop.year <- female.names$prop[years==my.year]

# What was the most popular female name in 1994?
most.popular(1994)



### Bonus ###

# Write a function `how.popular` that takes in a name and a year, and returns
# a sentence with how popular that name was in that year

how.popular <- function(my.name, my.year){
  names <- female.names$name[female.names$year == my.year]
  props <- female.names$prop[female.names$year == my.year]

how.popular("Laura", 1995)

# How popular was the name 'Laura' in 1995?
